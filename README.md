# About this project

## Context

This project was my very first "real" project in Python (which was my first coding language). 
I started it during my last year in high school and it was pretty... messy [(check the initial code)](./games/warship_v1.py).
This project made me enjoy Python and programming that's why I decided to make the code a little better over time.

## Some special rules

So, as I said, this game is the first one that i had to do so I had to modify the original game rules in order to make the game easier to code ðŸ˜…

---

### The Rules:
- 1v1 against an AI
- Infinite mode or limited amount of a turns
- Small boats with a heigth and length of 1
- 6x6 grid (because of 1x1 boats the game easily gets boring with 10x10 grid and is too fast with 5x5)
- The player has to place 4 boats
- Game ends when there is no more turn or every player's or AI's boat are destroyed

# Overview

### Here are some screenshots of the game:

# Language used

## Python

This project is made out of Python language and contains basic functions and imports since this is a beginner project.
I hope that the code may help you, have fun with it !
